Create a webpage with a list of customers.
Present the data in a readable and clean way as the primary page element. A way of displaying data is of your choice.
Customer available data:
● Name
● Surname
● Email
● Phone number
● Age
● City
Add functionality to add new customers to the list with some fields required and some optional. Add option to sort customers list by name and city.
The preferable way of presenting "add" functionality is in a popup or in a new page. Functionality should be triggered by the "Add new customer" button.
Technology and approach in any sense are of your choice. Please, if it is possible, avoid using built-in bootstrap sort. The data can be stored in the memory as the database is not an element of the test.
